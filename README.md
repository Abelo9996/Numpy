# Numpy
Implementation of a slower version of numpy, yet an optimized version of a naive solution.

This implementation is a C project as well as a performance project. This is my implementation of a slower version of numpy. My version of numpy, numc (how exciting!), is most likely to be slower than numpy, but much faster than the naive implementations of matrix operations.

Do not expect the final completed numc module to be as good as numpy, but you should expect a very large speedup compared to the naive solution, especially for matrix multiplication and exponentiation!
